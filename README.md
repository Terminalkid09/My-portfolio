# My Portfolio

This is the source code of my personal developer portfolio.  
I built it to have a clean and minimal place where people can see who I am, what I build, and how I think as a developer.

The goal is simple: show my projects clearly, without overcomplicating things, and keep everything lightweight and easy to maintain.

## 🚀 Features

- A minimal and fast UI  
- A section with all my main projects  
- A short introduction about me and what I focus on  
- A structure that I can update anytime without breaking anything  

No frameworks, no unnecessary dependencies — just code that works.
